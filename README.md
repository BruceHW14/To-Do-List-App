 To do list 
This is a to do list webpage, this is a place to store your to-dos so that you don't forget.
It is a basic reminder of what still needs to get done.
You simply fill out the text field with whatever you have planned to do on the day,
you then choose either business or personal to state which category the task will fall under.

It will then save to the todo list section and from there you can tick or un-tick it.
You can edit your todo in case it has changed in any way.
You can even delete the task once it is done and not needed anymore.

This is a simple yet efficient way of keeping track of all your todo's and making sure you can everything done.
